<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p>
Both these plays have been written for
Mr. Fay’s “Irish National Theatre.” “The
King’s Threshold” was played in October,
1903, and “On Baile’s Strand” will be
played in February or March, 1904. Both
are founded on Old Irish Prose Romances,
but I have borrowed some ideas for the
arrangement of my subject in “The King’s
Threshold” from “Sancan the Bard,” a
play published by Mr. Edwin Ellis some
ten years ago.

<h3>A PROLOGUE.<a name="Anchor_1" id="Anchor_1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<a class="pagenum" id="Page_5" title="5"></a>
</h3>


<div class="prose">

<p class="scene-description">
An <span class="character-minor">Old Man</span> with a red dressing-gown, red
slippers and red nightcap, holding a
brass candlestick with a guttering candle
in it, comes on from side of stage and
goes in front of the dull green curtain.
</p>


<div class="speaker">Old Man.</div>
<p>
I’ve got to speak the prologue.
[<span class="stage-direction">He shuffles on a few steps.</span>] My nephew,
who is one of the play actors, came to me,
and I in my bed, and my prayers said, and
the candle put out, and he told me there
were so many characters in this new play,
that all the company were in it, whether
they had been long or short at the business,<!-- p006.png/Page 6 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_6" title="6"></a>
and that there wasn’t one left to speak the
prologue. Wait a bit, there’s a draught
here. [<span class="stage-direction">He pulls the curtain closer together.</span>]
That’s better. And that’s why I’m here,
and maybe I’m a fool for my pains.
</p>

<p>
And my nephew said, there are a good
many plays to be played for you, some to-night
and some on other nights through
the winter, and the most of them are simple
enough, and tell out their story to the end.
But as to the big play you are to see to-night,
my nephew taught me to say what
the poet had taught him to say about it.
[<span class="stage-direction">Puts down candlestick and puts right finger
on left thumb.</span>] First, he who told the story
of Seanchan on King Guaire’s threshold
long ago in the old books told it wrongly, for
he was a friend of the king, or maybe afraid
of the king, and so he put the king in the
right. But he that tells the story now,
being a poet, has put the poet in the right.
</p>

<p>
And then [<span class="stage-direction">touches other finger</span>] I am to
say: Some think it would be a finer tale if<!-- p007.png/Page 7 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_7" title="7"></a>
Seanchan had died at the end of it, and
the king had the guilt at his door, for that
might have served the poet’s cause better
in the end. But that is not true, for if he
that is in the story but a shadow and an
image of poetry had not risen up from the
death that threatened him, the ending would
not have been true and joyful enough to
be put into the voices of players and proclaimed
in the mouths of trumpets, and
poetry would have been badly served.
</p>

<p class="stage-direction">
<span class="no-italic">[</span>He takes up the candlestick again.
</p>

<p>
And as to what happened Seanchan after,
my nephew told me he didn’t know, and
the poet didn’t know, and it’s likely there’s
nobody that knows. But my nephew thinks
he never sat down at the king’s table again,
after the way he had been treated, but that
he went to some quiet green place in the
hills with Fedelm, his sweetheart, where
the poor people made much of him because
he was wise, and where he made songs and
poems, and it’s likely enough he made some<!-- p008.png/Page 8 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_8" title="8"></a>
of the old songs and the old poems the
poor people on the hillsides are saying and
singing to-day.
</p>

<p class="stage-direction">
<span class="no-italic">[</span>A trumpet-blast.
</p>

<p>
Well, it’s time for me to be going. That
trumpet means that the curtain is going to
rise, and after a while the stage there will
be filled up with great ladies and great
gentlemen, and poets, and a king with a
crown on him, and all of them as high up
in themselves with the pride of their youth
and their strength and their fine clothes as
if there was no such thing in the world as
cold in the shoulders, and speckled shins,
and the pains in the bones and the stiffness
in the joints that make an old man that has
the whole load of the world on him ready
for his bed.
</p>

<p class="stage-direction">
<span class="no-italic">[</span>He begins to shuffle away, and then
stops.
</p>

<p>
And it would be better for me, that
nephew of mine to be thinking less of his
play-acting, and to have remembered to
boil down the knap-weed with a bit of three-penny<!-- p009.png/Page 9 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_9" title="9"></a>
sugar, for me to be wetting my throat
with now and again through the night, and
drinking a sup to ease the pains in my
bones.
</p>

<p class="stage-direction">
<span class="no-italic">[</span>He goes out at side of stage.

a woman with a fish’s tail, and on the

It’s a woman from among the
Riders of the Sidhe. It’s Boann herself
from the river. She has left the Dagda’s
bed, and gone through the salt of the sea
and up here to the strand of Baile, and all
for love of me. Let her keep her husband’s
bed, for she’ll have none of me. Nobody
knows how lecherous these goddesses are.
I see her in every kind of shape but oftener
than not she’s in the wind and cries “give
a kiss and put your arms about me.” But
no, she’ll have no more of me. Yesterday<!-- p071.png/Page 71 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_71" title="71"></a>
when I put out my lips to kiss her, there
was nothing there but the wind. She’s

dog’s head on this. They have brought out
our master’s chair. Now I know what the
horse-boys were talking about. We must
not stay here. The Kings are going to
meet here. Now that Concobar and our
master, that is his chief man, have put
down all the enemies of Ullad, they are
going to build up Emain again. They are
going to talk over their plans for building
it. Were you ever in Concobar’s town
before it was burnt? O, he is a great King,
for though Emain was burnt down, every
war had made him richer. He has gold
and silver dishes, and chessboards and
candlesticks made of precious stones. Fool,
have they taken the top from the ale vat?</p>

<p>About the young man and the

<!-- p073.png/Page 73 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_73" title="73"></a>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>Yes.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>And after that we can go and
eat the fowl, for I am hungry.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>Time enough, time enough.
You’re in as great a hurry as when you
brought me to Aine’s Seat, where the mad
dogs gather when the moon’s at the full.
Go on with your story.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>I was creeping under a ditch,
with the fowl in my leather bag, keeping
to the shore where the farmer could not see
me, when I came upon a ship drawn up
upon the sands, a great red ship with a
woman’s head upon it.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>A ship out of Aoife’s country.
They have all a woman’s head on the
bow.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>There was a young man with a
pale face and red hair standing beside it.
Some of our people came up whose turn it
was to guard the shore. I heard them ask
the young man his name. He said he was
under bonds not to tell it. Then words<!-- p074.png/Page 74 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_74" title="74"></a>
came between them, and they fought, and
the young man killed half of them, and the
others ran away.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>It matters nothing to us, but he
has come at last.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>Who has come?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>I know who that young man
is. There is not another like him in the
world. I saw him when I had my eyesight.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>You saw him?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>I used to be in Aoife’s country
when I had my eyesight.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>That was before you went on
shipboard and were blinded for putting a
curse on the wind?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>Queen Aoife had a son that
was red haired and pale faced like herself,
and everyone said that he would kill
Cuchullain some day, but I would not
have that spoken of.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>Nobody could do that. Who
was his father?</p>
<!-- p075.png/Page 75 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_75" title="75"></a>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>Nobody but Aoife knew that,
not even he himself.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>Not even he himself! Was Aoife
a goddess and lecherous?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>I overheard her telling that she
never had but one lover, and that he was
the only man who overcame her in battle.
There were some who thought him one of
the Riders of the Sidhe, because the child
was great of limb and strong beyond others.
The child was begotten over the mountains;
but come nearer and I will tell you
something.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>You have thought something?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>When I hear the young girls
talking about the colour of Cuchullain’s
eyes, and how they have seven colours, I
have thought about it. That young man
has Aoife’s face and hair, but he has
Cuchullain’s eyes.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>How can he have Cuchullain’s
eyes?</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>He is Cuchullain’s son.</p>
<!-- p076.png/Page 76 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_76" title="76"></a>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>And his mother has sent him
hither to fight his father.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>It is all quite plain. Cuchullain
went into Aoife’s country when he was a
young man that he might learn skill in arms,
and there he became Aoife’s lover.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>And now she hates him because
he went away, and has sent the son to kill
the father. I knew she was a goddess.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>And she never told him who his
father was, that he might do it. I have
thought it all out, fool. I know a great
many things because I listen when nobody
is noticing and I keep my wits awake.
What ails you now?</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>I have remembered that I am
hungry.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>Well, forget it again, and I will
tell you about Aoife’s country. It is full of
wonders. There are a great many Queens
there who can change themselves into
wolves and into swine and into white hares,
and when they are in their own shapes they<!-- p077.png/Page 77 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_77" title="77"></a>
are stronger than almost any man; and
there are young men there who have cat’s
eyes and if a bird chirrup or a mouse squeak
they cannot keep them shut, even though
it is bedtime and they sleepy; and listen,
for this is a great wonder, a very great
wonder: there is a long narrow bridge, and
when anybody goes to cross it, that the
Queens do not like, it flies up as this bench
would if you were to sit on the end of it.
Everybody who goes there to learn skill
in arms has to cross it. It was in that
country too that Cuchullain got his spear
made out of dragon bones. There were
two dragons fighting in the foam of the sea,
and their grandam was the moon, and nine
Queens came along the shore.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>I won’t listen to your story.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>It is a very wonderful story.
Wait till you hear what the nine Queens did.
Their right hands were all made of silver.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>No, I will have my dinner first.
You have eaten the fowl I left in front of<!-- p078.png/Page 78 --><a class="pagenum" id="Page_78" title="78"></a>
the fire. The last time you sent me to steal
something you made me forget all about it
till you had eaten it up.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>No, there is plenty for us both.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>Come with me where it is.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>[<span class="stage-direction">Who is being led towards the
door at the back by <span class="character-major">Barach</span>.</span>] O, it is all
right, it is in a safe place.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
<p>It is a fine fowl. It was the
biggest in the yard.</p>

<div class="speaker">Fintain.</div>
<p>It had a good smell, but I hope
that the wild dogs have not smelt it. [<span class="stage-direction">Voices
are heard outside the door at the side.</span>] Here
is our master. Let us stay and talk with
him. Perhaps Cuchullain will give you a
new cap with a feather. He told me that
he would give you a new cap with a feather,
a feather with an eye that looks at you, a
peacock’s feather.</p>

<div class="speaker">Barach.</div>
